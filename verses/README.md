# Bible Verse Parser

This Bible verse parser is still in progress, but the eventual idea is to be able to tell what the following strings mean:

* Genesis 1:1
* Genesis 1:1-5
* Genesis 1:1-4:1
* Genesis 1:1, 5:1
* John 3:16, Romans 5:1-5, Revelation 1:3 - 2:5

## Credits
* I totally ripped `bible.yml` with some additions/modififications from https://github.com/endium/bible_reference_parser
