**Status:** pre-alpha

Metamorphosis is an async data processing framework, written in TypeScript. It draws inspiration from functional-reactive programming libraries like RxJS, Most.js, and Kefir as well as from libraries like Kafka streams.

Metamorphosis makes heavy use of async iterators for flow control and as such requires Node 10+.
