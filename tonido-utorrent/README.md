#Remote Desktop

An application written in PHP for the [Tonido Personal Cloud](http://tonido.com).

Powered by WinVNC, Flashlight-VNC, jQuery, SWFObject, Require.js, PHP, and lots
of hours of custom coding.

##Todo

Future versions will be powered by HTML5 technologies (Websockets, Canvas, etc.).  
This will eliminate some of the current issues with port binding issues / Flash / 
policy files / etc.
