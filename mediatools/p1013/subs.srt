184
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,933
What the 's going on?

198
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,163
Where the  did he get another phone?

225
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,401
Oh, .

227
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,130
What the  was that?

253
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,405
Where the  is he, people?

263
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,823
Where the  is he?

269
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,845
Oh, . !
He's reaching for something.

270
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,009
Oh, , he's got a gun.
Stay on the line.

296
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,457
 .

449
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,165
The safe is empty. .

454
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,633
  it! Get a backup team in there!

487
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,611
What the  are you doing? I'm trying
to send him a message.

518
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,115
What the  is this?

520
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,398
What the  just happened?

522
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,194
!

530
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,620
For 's sake, Pam, we're in
the middle of an operation.

531
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:26,993
.

650
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,410
She's in league with Jason Bourne,
for 's sakes!

747
01:16:51,457 --> 01:16:52,924
It's a  of a risk.

843
01:24:45,397 --> 01:24:46,386
 it!

846
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,705
He's got everything.   it!

850
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:05,113
Every room, every hallway,
every closet, every  air duct.

858
01:25:22,067 --> 01:25:25,093
Four-fifteen-seventy-one? , Pam.

876
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:26,017
Oh, my . It's a code.

888
01:28:56,348 --> 01:28:57,474
Oh, .

901
01:31:59,398 --> 01:32:01,730
Just get the  out of there.

929
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:41,051
 it! South bay! Go!
