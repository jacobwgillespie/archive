8
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,800
What a mess.

9
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,520
You've never seen a dead man before?

10
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,160
Put a blanket on him. Cover him.

11
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,560
I'm coming.

12
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,480
Be careful.

13
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,960
One minute. I'll be right there. Cover him.

14
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,520

What the hell
are you doing to me?

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,920

18
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,120
What are you doing?

19
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,400
Goddamn it! Where am I?

20
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,920
A boat! A fishing boat.
You were in the water.

21
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,320
We pulled you out.

22
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,640
What water?

23
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,120
You were shot. See?
There are the bullets.

24
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,680
Look, there is a number
for a bank. Why was it in your hip?

25
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,960
My hip?

26
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,680
-Why was it in your hip?
-My hip.

27
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,400
Yeah, in your hip under the skin.

28
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,840
Oh, God.

29
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,760
What are you doing with me?
You need to rest.

30
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,480
Please. Lie down.

31
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,520
I'm a friend. I'm your friend.

32
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,480
My name is Giancarlo.

33
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,440
Who are you?

34
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,200
What's your name?

35
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,360
What's your name?

36
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,120
I don't know.

37
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,720
Oh, God.
Lie down.

38
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,720

39
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,680

40
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,680
It's been confirmed, sir. Mission failed.

41
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,920

42
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,240

43
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,040
Do you know who I am?

44
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,520
I do not know who I am.

45
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,920

46
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,560
Tell me who I am.

47
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,080
If you know who I am...

48
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,360
Please stop messing around...

49
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,560
...and tell me.

50
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,600

51
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,760
If you want to eat, get in there.

52
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,640
Based on these charts,
I think I may have been closer to the coast.

53
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,360
What is this? You tie these knots?

54
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,840
So, it starts to come back?
No, it doesn't.

55
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,760
The knot's Iike everything eIse.
I found the rope and I did it.

56
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,280
Same way I can read.

57
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,960
I can write. I can add, subtract.
I can make coffee.

58
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,600
I can shuffle cards, play chess.
Yes, it will come back.

59
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,840
No, it's not coming back, goddamn it!
That's the point!

60
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,680
I'm down here looking through this,
all this shit!

61
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,840
For two weeks I'm down here.

62
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,880
It's not working.
I don't even know what to look for.

63
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,520
You need to rest. It will come back.

64
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,080
What if it doesn't come back?

65
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,600
We get in there tomorrow,
I don't even have a name.

66
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,280

67
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,600

68
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,720
It's not much,
but it shouId get you to Switzerland.

69
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,640
Thank you.

70
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,200

71
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,400

72
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,400
Can't you read the signs?

73
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,360
On your feet...let's go...right now.

74
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,840
The park is closed.
There's no sleeping in the park.

75
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,480
All right.

76
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,640
Let's see some identification.

77
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,520
No, I don't

78
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,960
Come on...your papers.

79
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,840
I don't have any papers. I lost my....

80
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,880
I've lost them...my papers...they are lost.

81
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,840
Ok...let's go...put your hands up.

82
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,680
...I just need to sleep...

83
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,120

84
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,000
These people have threatened my family.
My babies.

85
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,480
So I'm telling you,
when the evidence is clear...

86
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,040
...I will have a nice story
for you to read about.

87
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,200
And all my friends out there,
you will read about yourselves.

88
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,920
If you want to play this game...

89
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,200
...after I have been reasonable,
I will show you.

90
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,120
That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in Paris
the day before yesterday.

91
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,720
He was an irritation before he took power,
a problem...

92
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,400
...when he was in power,
and he's been a disaster for us in exile.

93
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,920
He's writing a book
about the Agency's history in Africa.

94
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,400
He's going to name names.

95
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,520
It's basically a shakedown.
He's demanding the Agency's help.

96
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,240
He wants us to put him back in power
in six months, or else.

97
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,640
This interview, and I'll make the tape
available to whoever wants it...

98
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,240
...he goes on to claim that he's just survived
an assassination attempt.

99
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,600
He says it's us. He says he's got proof.

100
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,160
The Director wants to know
if there's any truth...

101
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,080
...in this accusation.

102
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,120
I've already assured him there's nobody
that reckless on my senior staff.

103
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,840
I was recalling a conversation
we had some time ago.

104
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,480
Talking about Treadstone.

105
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,320
I seem to remember Wombosi's name
might have come up.

106
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,360
I'm not sure what we're talking about.

107
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,080
Someone tried to take him out.

108
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,000
Tried and failed.

109
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,600
Was this Treadstone?

110
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,800
You're asking me a direct question?

111
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,440
Yes.

112
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,960
I thought you were never gonna do that.

113
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,320
What happened?

114
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Well, we lost the communication
with our man.

115
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,440
This was almost two weeks ago.

116
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,920
We've worked around the clock.

117
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,160
We've been sleeping down there.
We're doing everything we can.

118
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,160
And you don't let me know this?
You never wanted to before.

119
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,240
You never made a mistake before.

What can I do for you?

124
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,280
Yes, I'm here about a numbered account.

125
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,240
If you just enter your account number here,
I'll direct you to an appropriate officer.

I'm trying to think...

135
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,360
How long's it been since I was here last?

136
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm not sure.

137
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,160
It must be three weeks.

138
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,440
Yes, in Paris.

139
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,400
Do you have the number
for a Jason Bourne?

140
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,800
Yes. Would you like me to connect you?

Okay.

152
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,680
Hold it.

153
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,480
You've no jurisdiction here.

154
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,280
Hold it there. Okay?

155
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
No.

156
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,640
Excuse me. No.
This is not my current address, okay?

157
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,160
This was my address until two days ago,
when I started standing in line.

158
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,600
Now I lose my apartment, okay?

159
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,480
That means no address, no phone,
no money, no time.

160
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,840
-And I still have no visa!
-Miss Kreutz, please.

161

I must ask you
to keep your voice down.

162
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,080
Excuse me. But where's the guy
that I talked to last week?

163
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,560
Every week it's a new person.
How am I supposed to

164
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,280
I don't know who you saw last week.

165
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,920
Let me help you. I'm sure I have it.
Hang on.

166
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,040
Could I have your attention for a moment?

167
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,160
I have it right here. Just Iook at it.

168
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,400
You staged an effort to circumvent
the immigration laws of the United States.

169
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,440
This is a student visa now.

170
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,200
It's not about a green card anymore.
It's very different.

171
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,280
It's not a menu. You don't just....
I brought all this proof.

172
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,760
Potential suspect....

173
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,040
Help in assault incident.

174
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,520
You! Red bag! The red bag!

175
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,400
Stop right there! Put your hands up!

176
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,120

177
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,280

178
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,880

179
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,360
I'm on it.

180
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,960
Move it! Now!
Now! Move!

181
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,240
Alpha Unit, take the back stairs
and work your way up. Bravo--

182
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,920

183
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,640
Move in! Move in!

184
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,320
Okay, clear!

185
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,640
Suspect is

186
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,840
Moving up staircase.
Proceeding to second floor.

187
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Alpha Unit, you're clear.

188
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,000
Move! Move!

189
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,040
All Units, target may have a radio.

190
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,120
Go to Code 77. Over.

191
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,200
Code 77, copy.

192
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,760
The floor! Down!

193
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,800
Clear!

194
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,320

195
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,440

196
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,600

197
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,600
Go. Move up.

198
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,000
He's in Zurich now? Right now?
Yes. It just came in.

199
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,360
-They're sure it's him?
-Yes. He went to the bank.

200
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,280
Our source at the bank, that's who called.

201
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,160
Come on.

202
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,560
But he's got to assume
we're watching the bank, right?

203
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,680
I don't know. Come on.

204
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,720
I mean, he cleaned out the box.
He left a gun. What does that mean?

205
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,760
I said I don't know!

206
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,120
I liked it better when I thought he was dead.

207
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,800

208
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,720
What are you looking at?

209
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,480
I heard you inside.

210
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,400
What?

211
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,040
The consulate. I heard you talking.
I thought maybe we could help each other.

212
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,120
How's that?

213
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,840
You need money. I need a ride out of here.

214
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,840
I'm not running a car service. Thank you.

215
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,920
I'll give you $10,000 to drive me to Paris.

216
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,920

217
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,800
What, do you think I'm a fool?

218
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,880
You'd be a fool not to take it.

219
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,320
Is this a joke? Some kind of scam?
No, it's no scam.

220
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,360
I'll give you another $10,000
when we arrive.

221
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,120
Jesus.

222
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,080

223
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,680
-Is that for you?
-Look. You drive, I pay. It's that simple.

224
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,080
I got enough trouble, okay?

225
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,520
Okay.

226
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,480
Can I have my money back?

227
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,280
All right, go. Keep going.

228
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,960
Go.

229
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,920
-There! Wait!
-No, it's got to be near the end.

230
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,880
Come on, folks! We caught a break here!
Let's go!

231
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,040
Okay, I'm up.

232
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,040
We're getting grids.
Airline, train, hotels, hospitals.

233
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,520
-Who's getting the address? The street?
-Gemensheidt.

234
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,680
Here we go.
I think I got it.

235
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,040
Is it him?

236
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,520
Unreal.

237
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,160
This is 38 minutes ago.

238
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,600
Zurich police are looking
for an American carrying a red bank bag.

239
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,560
He just tore up the embassy and
put two cops in the hospital last night.

240
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Get everybody up. Do it now.
I want them all activated.

241
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,840
Wait. All of them? At the same time?

242
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,400
You heard me.
I want Bourne in a body bag by sundown.

243
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,200
All right, let's get a map up here!
Come on, folks! Let's work it!

...which was fine with me
because I was ready.

266
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,600
After six months in Amsterdam,
you're not sure...

267
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,680
...if you've been there 20 minutes or years,
you know.

268
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,760
So I went. I took all the money I had.
I went in with friends...

269
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,280
...we took over this really cool surf shop
outside Biarritz, right by the water.

270
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,040
It was amazing.

271
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,400
It was just amazing for about three months,
until it turned out that this...

272
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,840
...jerk who had fronted us the lease
was actually shining everyone on and....

273
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,480
And what?

274
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,080
What do you mean ''what''? Listen to me.

275
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,640
I've been speed-talking
for about 60 kilometers now.

276
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,840
I taIk when I'm nervous.
I mean, I talk like this when I'm nervous.

277
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,240
-I'm gonna shut up now.
-No, don't do that.

278
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,200
I haven't talked to anybody in a while.

279
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,720
Yeah, but we're not talking. I'm talking.

280
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,600
You've said,
like, 10 words since we left Zurich.

281
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,240
Well, listening to you, it's relaxing.

282
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,000
I haven't slept in a while and....

283
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,520
And I've had this headache.

284
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,840
It's like a constant thing in my head...

285
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,160
...and it's just starting
to move to the background...

286
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,640
...so keep going.

287
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,160
Really, if you want, please keep talking.

288
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,000
Okay.

289
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,640
What kind of music do you like?

290
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,480
What do you like? Come on.

291
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,040
-You know what? Never mind.
-No, it's fine. Tell me.

292
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,760
What do you want to listen to?

293
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,840
I don't know.

294
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,880
Come on, it's not that hard.
What do you like? Tell me.

295
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,880
I don't know.

296
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,040
Who pays $20,000 for a ride to Paris?

297
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,920
Fuck it.

298
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,160
I can't remember anything
that happened before two weeks ago.

299
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,200
-Lucky you.
-No, I'm serious.

300
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,120
I don't know who I am.
I don't know where I'm going.

301
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,720
None of it.

302
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,680
What? Like amnesia?
Yes.

303
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,480
Amnesia.
Yes.

304
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,480
Right.

305
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,680
-And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
-That's the only angle.

306
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,000
What do they have of the streets?
Or, you know, the area?

307
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,280
They must have something.

308
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,560
Hang on.

309
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,080
What is he doing?

310
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,960
Is it a game? Is he warning us?
Is it a threat?

311
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,520
Sir? Look at this.

312
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,960
-What's that?
-It's an angle of the street, a sort of alley.

313
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,720
Just enhance it.

314
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,640
Now, who the hell is that?

315
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,000
Marie Helena Kreutz.

316
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,520
She's 26, born outside Hanover.
Her father was a welder.

317
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,040
He died in '87.

318
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,440
We still don't have the mother.
The grandmother, she's still in Hanover.

319
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,120
It looks like she's the anchor
for this little domestic disaster.

320
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,720
And there's a stepbrother.

321
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,800
It's tough. The girl's a gypsy.

322
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,240
I mean, she pops up on the grid
here and there, but it's chaotic at best.

323
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,680
She paid some electric bills in Spain, '95.

324
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,680
Had a phone in her name
for three months in Belgium, '96.

325
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,120
No taxes, no credit.

326
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,040
I don't like her. I want to go deep.

327
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,560
Get a phone log for Granny
and the half-brother.

328
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,600
Anybody we can cross-file.

329
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,800
I want to know every place she's slept
in the past six years.

330
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,440
Have Paris get these out in the field.

331
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,840
TREADSTONE SAFE HOUSE
PARIS, FRANCE

332
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm not making this up.

333
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,840
These are real.

334
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,640
Okay.

335
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,360
Who has a safety deposit box full of...

336
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,760
...money and six passports and a gun?

337
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,040
Who has a bank account number
in their hip?

338
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,400
I come in here, and the first thing I'm doing
is I'm catching the sightlines...

339
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,680
...and looking for an exit.

340
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,920
I see the exit sign, too. I'm not worried.

341
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,400
I mean, you were shot.

342
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,080
People do all kinds of weird
and amazing stuff when they are scared.

343
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,680
I can tell you the license plate numbers
of all six cars outside.

344
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,880
I know that our waitress is left-handed...

345
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,560
...and the guy sitting at the counter weighs
215 pounds and can handle himself.

346
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,240
I know the best place to look for a gun
is the cab of the gray truck outside.

347
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,560
At this altitude, I can run flat out for
a half-mile before my hands start shaking.

348
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,520
Now why would I know that?

349
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,080
How can I know that
and not know who I am?

350
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,840

351
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,240
PARIS 103 - LILLE 350

352
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,040

353
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Hey.

354
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,720
I slept.

355
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,360
-I can't believe it.
-Yeah, well, you were tired.

356
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,680
I haven't slept.

357
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,880
Oh, here. For $20,000,
I like to throw in breakfast.

358
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,560
Did you stop for gas?

359
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,320
You were pretty out of it.

360
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,640
So, do you think there's,
like, a family waiting for you?

361
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,560
I don't know.

362
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,080
I've thought about it.

363
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,920
Is that it?

364
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,280
104.

365
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,800
Yeah, that's the address.
No, keep going. Keep going.

366
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,520
-Okay. Where?
-Just take a left. Pull in over here.

367
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,920
Okay.

368
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,640
So, this is it, right?

369
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,200
Yeah, I guess.

370
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,640
God, I don't recognize any of this.

371
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,480
Okay. I should go.

372
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,760
Jason?

373
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,960
Oh, God. The money. Right.

374
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,640
Yeah.

375
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,400
Here.

376
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,280
Thank you. Okay.

377
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,880
Thanks for the ride.

378
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,720
Anytime.

379
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,600
Well, you could come up.
I mean, or you can wait here.

380
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,960
-I can go check it out. But you could wait.
-Oh, no, no.

381
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,600
You could wait.

382
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,040
With you, you would probably
just forget about me if I stayed here.

383
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,720
How could I forget about you?

384
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,360
You're the only person I know.

385
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,160
Yeah. That's true.

386
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,640
I guess you're not home.

387
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,800

388
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,560
Monsieur Bourne, there you are.

389
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,000

390
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,040
Monsieur Bourne, I was wondering--
I haven't seen you.

391
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,560
Uh, here I am.

392
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,720

393
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,280
I think I forgot my key.

394
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,120

395
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,560
Hello?

396
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,120
Are you sure this is all yours?

397
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,520
I guess.

398
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,080
This is my kitchen.

399
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,040
Any cIues?

400
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,840
I think I'm in the shipping business.

401
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,040
So it's all coming back?

402
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,200
Do you mind if I use the bathroom?

403
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,000
Sure.

404
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,000
Okay.

405
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,880

406
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,360
Yeah. Hello? Hello?

407
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,840
Yes, sir, Hotel Regina, Paris.
How may I direct your call?

408
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,120
Yeah, you're in Paris?
Yes, sir.

409
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,480
I'm looking for a guest there.

410
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,360
A Jason Bourne.

411
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,560
One moment, please.
Thank you.

412
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,440
I'm afraid I have no one
by that name registered.

413
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,800
Okay. Thank you.

414
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,840
Wait! No, no. Are you there? Hello?

415
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,640
Sir?

416
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,520
Can you check
another name for me, please?

417
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,760
Here, bear with me one second.

418
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,240
John Kane. Kane with a "K"
One moment, sir.

419
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,560
Thank you.

420
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,440
You call about Monsieur Kane?
John Michael Kane?

421
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,320
Yeah, that's right.

422
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,280
You are a friend of his?
Yeah.

423
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,040
I have some very bad news for you, sir.

424
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:22,360
I'm sorry to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane
has passed away almost two weeks ago.

425
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,400
There was an accident. On the motorway.

426
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,840
Apparently, he was killed instantly.

427
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,800
Really, I'm terribly sorry
to be the one to tell you this.

428
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,000
When they came for his things,
it was made known for us, you see?

429
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,400
Who came?

430
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,880
His brother.

431
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,120
Did his brother leave a number
or a way to get in touch with him?

432
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,520
I think not.

433
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,160
No, I'm sorry.

434
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,520

435
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,640
Jason? There's no hot water.

436
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,720
It's freezing.

437
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,240
I'll go try the water in the kitchen.

438
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,320
Why don't you just stay in the bathroom?
I'll see if I can get it hot.

439
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,280

440
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,960
Yeah, it's really coId in here, too.

441
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,560
The water is still cold.

442
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,280
Yeah, it's cold in the kitchen, too.
I got it running, though.

443
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,720
So....

444
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,440
What?

445
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,200
Nothing.

446
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,000
Are you okay?

447
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,240
Yeah.

448
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,320
What is it?

449
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,080
Something wrong?

450
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,120

451
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,800
Jason!

452
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,760

453
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,440
Open that. Tell me what's inside.

454
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,920
Who are you?

455
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,880
Who are you?

456
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,080
Who are you?

457
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,440

458
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,920
Oh, my God.

459
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,080

460
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,440
God.

461
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,560
Answer me! Who are you?

462
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,920
-He's got my picture!
-All right. Hang on.

463
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,400
This is Zurich, yesterday!
Don't

464
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,200
I don't know. Where did you get this?

465
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,760
Stay there.
How did you get my picture?

466
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,840
Where did you get this from?

467
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,800
How did you get my.... My God!

468
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,600
I'll do this! You stay there. Stay there!

469
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,560

470
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,320
-Where are your shoes? Get your shoes.
-Sure. Yeah, sure.

471
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,000
He went out the window.
Why would someone do that?

472
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,440
We can't stay here. It's not safe.

473
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,080
I can get us out of here, but we got to go.
We got to go right now.

474
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,240
Okay, look, you can wait.

475
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,640
You can wait for the cops. It's okay.

476
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,120
You just wait for them to get here.
But I can't. I got to go.

477
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,080
Marie?

478
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,320
Marie?

479
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,440

480
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,120
Quiet. Be quiet.

481
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,040

482
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,120
Don't look.

483
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,880

484
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,640

485
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,760

486
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,840

487
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,400
Code in.

488
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,840
Alpha 37509.

489
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,160

490
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,280
Yeah.

491
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,760
Hang on.

492
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,680
Bourne went to Paris, to the apartment.

493
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,520
We got him? Tell me.
He killed our man.

494
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,400
What? In the apartment?
Yeah.

495
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,040
Well, you got to clean that up.
No, I can't clean it up.

496
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,040
There's a body in the street.
So?

497
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,720
There's police. This is Paris.

498
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,840
Put up the scanners.
Get as much radio information as you can.

499
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,440
Okay, you stay here.

500
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,840
I'm gonna go find a place for this money.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

501
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,800

502
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,680
Hey, I told you to stay in the car.

503
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,000
Jesus Christ. I told you to stay in the car.

504
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,480
I needed a drink.
I didn't think you would come back.

505
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,880
Look, you got to go to the cops.

506
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,240
Right now.
You got to go before this gets any worse.

507
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,040
By myself?
It's gonna be okay.

508
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,920
You're gonna take my passport, okay?
You show this to them.

509
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,040
You have that picture, you have the $20,000.

510
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,920
You tell them everything that happened.
They'll believe you.

511
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,560
They have to believe you.

512
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,360
Marie, you can't just sit here.
It's not safe here.

513
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,480
Safe?
This is from inside the embassy.

514
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,200
-Who can do this? This is from yesterday.
-I don't know.

515
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,120
How can they know we're together?
I'm trying to do the right thing.

516
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,960
That's all.
Right?

517
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,480
How'll you make this right
by sending me there alone?

518
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,720
You think I want you to go to the cops?
That's good?

519
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,840
-You want to go, fine.
-If you go, I run!

520
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,640
-You tell them what happened!
-I don't know what happened!

521
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,960
I don't know who this guy was
or about that picture!

522
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,800
I don't know who I am!

523
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,280
Look, I'm....

524
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,400
You think I'm trying to burn you.
I'm trying to do the right thing.

525
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,440
Nobody does the right thing.

526
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,240
Look, I can't run with you. I can't.

527
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,560
We run, I got to Iive Iike this. I got to....
I don't even know who I'm hiding from.

528
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,560
These people know who I am.

529
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,920
Yeah, I got to stay here.
I got to figure this out.

530
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,560
So figure it out.

531
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,040
You take care of this car?

532
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,320
What do you mean?

533
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,080
The tires felt a little splashy
on the way over here.

534
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,440
It pulls a little to the right.

535
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,600
POLICE

536
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,480

537
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,040

538
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,680
Last chance, Marie.

539
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,360

540
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,480

541
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,280

542
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,440

543
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,000
So....

544
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,000
What?
We got a bump coming up.

545
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,560

546
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,560
Turn your head away. Turn your head away.

547
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,520

548
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,200
We can never come back to this car.

549
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,280
You understand?

550
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,560
Okay, we're gonna clean it out,
and I'll wipe it down, and we walk away.

551
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,200
-That's it.
-Okay.

552
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,880
Okay. And I'll find a place for us to rest.
And I got to think.

553
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,080
Do you have a hat or a scarf or something?

554
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,560
-For my hair?
-Yeah. Just until we can change it.

555
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,080
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

556
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,280
Okay.

557
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,480
HOFFENMEIN MORGUE - PARIS, FRANCE

558
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,920

559
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,600
560
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,360
It's not him.

561
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,920
This man was not shot.

562
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,400

563
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,960
What do you have?

564
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,280
Wombosi went to the morgue.

565
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,280
He saw the body. He didn't buy it.

566
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,400
Where is he now?

567
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,800
I told you, I'm not staffed for this.

568
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,040
Where is he? Right now!
Where's Wombosi?

569
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,440
They were leaving the morgue.

570
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,960
They just left.

571
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,520
Sir, what do you want to do?

572
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,680

573
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,880
I need to get the bottle.

574
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,400
Hey.

575
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,360
You already cleaned the room?

576
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,160
I wiped the whole place down
for fingerprints.

577
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:02,000
Can I walk around
or is it gonna leave any footprints?

578
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:11,320
You can walk around. It's no problem.

579
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,360
But we'll just keep track
of everything we touch.

580
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,520
I think it's best if we leave a room,
that we don't leave a trail.

581
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,560
Why? Where are we going?

582
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,280
I need to go to the hotel
where John Michael Kane stayed.

583
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,760
The Hotel Regina.

584
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,320
If I was him,
then they're gonna have some records.

585
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,440
We need that hotel bill.

586
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,520
Okay.

587
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,440
It gets slightly complicated, though.

588
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,000
Because you're dead.

589
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,960
Right.

590
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,440
Please.
They want war, we'll make war.

591
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,840
If they want to kill me,
they better kill me the first time.

592
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,240
They better kill me dead.
They better kill me when I'm in my sleep.

593
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,560
Listen to me.
We need these people.

594
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,080
It's hard enough getting people
that we know to help us.

595
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,680
We must be careful.

596
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,800
We?

597
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,400
No, you.

598
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,720
You need to bring me back
that bastard kid's head...

599
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:09,640
...put it in front of this house,
and show them the war we're fighting.

600
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,040
But that is precisely--

601
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,360
Nykwana!

602
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,560

603
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,680
We'll give the watch
a reference check before we go.

604
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,560
Okay.

605
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,920
What's the pay phone number?

606
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,560
616-2468.

607
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,800
Exits?

608
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,160
There's three.

609
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:48,360
Service at the back,
side goes to the street past the shops...

610
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,320
...front is the best.

611
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:54,280
If I think I'm being followed, I walk out
with the bag over my right shoulder.

612
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,800
And if there's no taxi?

613
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:59,400
I keep on walking,
don't look back until you make contact.

614
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,520
What?

615
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,320
We need this, right?

616
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,120
Okay.

617
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,080

618
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,840
I need distances.

619
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,560
You walk in, you pick a spot.
Some midpoint in the lobby.

620
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,680
Count your steps to that spot,
and then remember that number.

621
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,480
Because after I call you,
I can get you moving.

622
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,000
You understand?

623
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,920
I also need a head count.

624
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,840
How many people from when you walk in
until you get to the desk.

625
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,680
How many hotel employees are there?
And obviously security.

626
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,840
And it might not be that easy
to see who they are.

627
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,320
So I'll call you, you give me the layout,
and we'll take it from there.

628
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,640

629
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,800
Regina.

630
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,840
Yes, the house phone in the lobby.

631
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,960

632
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,720

633
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,280
What happened?
I--

634
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,280
Did something go wrong?
I've got the records.

635
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,160
He, this guy at the front desk
was smiling at me.

636
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:27,280
So I thought, you know, all this trouble,
maybe it's easier to just ask for them.

637
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,200
You have the bill?
He made me a photocopy.

638
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,280
You just asked for it?

639
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,640
I said I was Mr. Kane's personal assistant.

640
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,400
Okay. That's good thinking.

641
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,200
Sir, can I--
No.

642
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,440
Wombosi was assassinated
in his house in the middle of Paris.

643
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,960
Yeah, we just heard.

644
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,640
It's him. It's Bourne. We're almost positive.

645
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,960
He had an assignment. He failed.

646
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,960
He obviously felt compelled
to finish the task.

647
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:14,880
Jesus.

648
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,920
We think he'll come back in now.

649
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,760
I mean, it's routine.

650
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,760
It's like behavioral software.

651
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,400
He's following a protocol.

652
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,640
Now that he's completed the mission,
we think he'll come back in.

653
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,880
They always do.

654
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,800
When?

655
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,080
How long till he checks in?

656
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,560
24 hours.
24?

657
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,280
Yeah, it's usually something like that.

658
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,840
Then what?

659
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,120
I told you we'd clean this up.

660
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,800
It will be clean.

661
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,360
I understand you're a dive shop,
but where are you located?

662
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,000
Marseilles?

663
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:06,720

664
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,680

665
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,720
What specifically does
your company supply?

666
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,840
I am sorry.
What is your name, monsieur?

667
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,520

668
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,960
You've been here for three hours
and you still can't find a print?

669
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,120

670
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,840
What?
Paris police found the vehicle.

671
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,960

672
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:05,760
You've reached Simon Rawlins
at Alliance Security, Maritime Division.

673
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,560
Paris office hours are
from 8.:00 a.m. to 5.:00 p.m.

674
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,600
I got a lead in Paris.

675
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,720
The rest were Marseilles,
and two out in Southampton.

676
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,080
-Paris? It's what?
-Alliance Security. Simon Rawlins.

677
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,480
I got a machine.

678
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,040

679
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,840

680
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,200
Mr. Kane?

681
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,320
Mr. Kane!

682
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,280
How are you?
I'm good. How are you?

683
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,160
Mr. Kane. Come right in.
Please have a seat.

684
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,560
Thank you.

685
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,640
So, this is the Palmer Johnson tri-deck.

686
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,680
I'm assuming you're still in the market.
It's still the same vessel?

687
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:08,560
Yes.

688
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,080

689
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,880
So I'm Kane.

690
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,760
They--
I had a meeting as Kane.

691
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,520
-They said--
-No. I'm definitely Kane.

692
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,120
I just had a meeting as Kane
and he knew me as Kane.

693
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,040
So I'm definitely Bourne.
I'm also just definitely Kane.

694
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,360
It's all just boats.

695
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,520
I got blueprints and cameras
and security systems.

696
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,840
I just found John Michael Kane's body.

697
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,480
In a morgue here in Paris.

698
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:55,080
But if you are John Michael Kane,
whose body do they have?

699
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,360
What was the name again?
Kane.

700
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,480
Kane.

701
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,880
John Michael Kane.

702
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,600
John Michael Kane.

703
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,360

704
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,000
Kane. It's number 1 21 .

705
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,720
I want to see the body.

706
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,960
Our boss could come back.
We are not supposed to do that.

707
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,040
Come on.

708
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,320
Is this it? I mean, where is he?

709
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,320
I don't know.

710
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,000

711
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,320
What's going on?

712
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,760
This guy has come to see the American.
But the body has disappeared.

713
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,720
They came yesterday evening...his brother.

714
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,280
He's not in the register.

715
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,800
Who are you? What's going on?

716
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,040
-Where's the body that goes in here?
-I said someone came last night.

717
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,640
I know. Where'd they take the body?

718
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,880
Look, this is not a carnival, okay?

719
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,600
People call, they make an appointment,
follow the rules.

720
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,800
Everyone signs in and out.
This is a serious place. Serious work.

721
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,640
-It's not just to come in whenever you like!
-You're right. We didn't sign in.

722
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,000
Get the hell out of here.

723
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,760
Fine. I'm just gonna go sign in.
Okay, go.

724
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,880
Is this it?

725
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,320
BOSS: You can't take the book.
This is it?

726
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,840
It's okay. There's a pencil in here.
That's fine.

727
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,920
Honey, why don't you go wait outside?
Here it is.

728
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,280
We can't have--
Okay.

729
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:33,640
Jason, what just happened in there?
What are you looking for?

730
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,280
Nykwana Wombosi.

731
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,280
Wombosi went to the morgue to visit Kane.

732
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,320
See?

733
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,440
So?
He's in the Alliance brochure.

734
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,040
Same guy.

735
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,640
This guy knows.

736
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,240

737
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,200

738
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,080
My French sucks. I can't....
It says something about a boat or....

739
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,800
I don't understand. What does it say?
You read it. Tell me. What?

740
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,680
It says that 3 weeks before he was killed,
Mr. Wombosi told police...

741
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,440
...that a man came onto his yacht,
five miles off the coast of Marseilles...

742
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,320
...and tried to kill him.

743
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,560
It says that he chased the man off the boat
and shot him twice in the back.

744
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,240
It says I'm an assassin.

745
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,120

746
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,600

747
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,680

748
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,000
Stop the car.

749
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,800
But no...you said Rue de I...
we're almost there.

750
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,520
Just right here, this is good.

751
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,720
I said stop.

752
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,800
What's going on?

753
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,720
Well...what's going on?

754
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,080
What the hell are you doing?

755
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,840
Go. Go.
What are--

756
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,360
You gave me too much.

757
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,480
We're blown. Come on.
Blown? What is "blown"?

758
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,600
Monsieur...your change, your change.

759
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,320
Sir, please...You can't stay here...
You have to leave.

760
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,520
Keep walking.

761
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,520
What do you think they're doing there?
They're on to the hotel.

762
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,480
-No. You don't know that.
-Trust me. Just keep walking.

763
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,040

764
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:07,600
765
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,960
Are you crazy? What are you doing now?

766
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,680
Jason!

767
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,640
This is blown.

768
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,760
Marie?
Get away.

769
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,000
Stop right there.
Get away from me.

770
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,760
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

771
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,160
Marie.
Is that next?

772
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,280
Listen, stay calm. Stay calm.

773
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,680
Whatever we do, we have to do it together.

774
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,040
-We have to be--
-We?

775
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:50,440
The only thing we had in common
was that neither of us knew who you were.

776
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,200
We've passed that now.
Listen!

777
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:55,560
The police will find us. The people who took
the picture in the embassy...

778
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,480
...who killed Wombosi,
they're gonna come here and kill us.

779
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,000
The people who you work for.

780
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:06,000
I will take you wherever you need to go.
I'll take you there. I'll leave you there.

781
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,520
You can do what you want.
You never have to see me again.

782
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,200
But not here.
If we stay here, we die.

783
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,720
Boy, great police work! Really brilliant!

784
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,520
Why don't they just hang out a banner
that says, ''Don't come back!''

785
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,400
Jesus Christ!
What is the French word for ''stakeout''?

786
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,760
Okay, this was 16 minutes ago.

787
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,760
This is our starting point.

788
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,320
Can't fly, trains are risky. Nicky?
Here.

789
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,720
I need to know everything
Paris's finest is doing on this.

790
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,960
I'm on it.

791
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,720
You said 24 hours, and he's not back.

792
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,960
No. But we got a good idea where he is.

793
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,000
You've got a black ops agent
who's off the reservation.

794
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,840
He trashed an American consulate.
He's on the run in Europe.

795
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:08,160
You don't know why. I got to stand
before an oversight committee.

796
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,840
What will I say about Treadstone?

797
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,080
You're worried about a budget meeting?

798
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,400
We don't take care of this,
we don't make it to the men's room.

799
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,360
Now, is that clear enough for you?

800
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,440
We will burn for this.

801
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,120
We will both of us burn.

802
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:28,200
All right, I want two teams.
Daryl, Ray, stay on the grids.

803
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,480
Brian, Harris, Steve...

804
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,400
...I want to work on this girl.

805
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:35,560
And this residency pattern?
We started it.

806
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:36,480
Get it out.

807
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,760

808
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,640
We cross-referenced
numbers from her relatives.

809
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,800
When we found convergence,
we took the numbers...

810
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:49,840
...back-checked them, ran a search merge
with other data we had, which wasn't much.

811
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,240
Pins. These pins.

812
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,640
These are all the places we think she's lived
in the last six years.

813
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,800
One, two, three, four, five.

814
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,560
That's our pool.

815
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,120
No answer.

816
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,680
How many times you let it ring?

817
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,360
-Look, if you don't want to go, I'll hitch.
-I said I'd take you.

818
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,200
Those are the targets.

819
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:21,040
Beg, borrow, hack, tap, bypass!
I don't care what you do!

820
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,840
I want to know everything you can tell me
about what's going on at those locations.

821
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:29,040

822
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,320
How do you know
he still owns this?

823
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,840
Eamon always had money.
He would never sell this.

824
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,000

825
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,720
Marie?

826
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:20,880
What?

827
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,960
We got to go.

828
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,680
What?

829
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:26,880
We got to go.

830
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:27,520

831
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,320
I thought it would....

832
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,720

833
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:40,560
Shit, that's Eamon. I'll talk to him.
We're leaving.

834
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,480
Eamon. Surprise.

835
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,720
It's me, Marie. Wow, God...

836
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,560
...there's a really good reason for this.

837
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,320
There bloody well better be.

838
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,880
Daddy!
Hang on. Hang on.

839
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,280
I had no idea you would be here.

840
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:04,720
Well, why would I be here?
It's only my bloody house, right?

841
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,520
Yeah.

842
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,400
Did she get you into this?

843
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,720
It was just gonna be for a day.

844
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,280
Daddy, Alain has to go pee!

845
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:19,000
All right, all right, come on. Here.
Get out of the car.

846
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,960
Okay, in you go.

847
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,520
Come on, Alain.

848
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:25,960
I'm sorry. I....

849
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,840
I thought it would be okay.
But I guess I was wrong.

850
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,360
-Let's find Mommy.
-Mommy?

851
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,720
Mommy is away for two days, thank God.

852
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,480
You've got yourself all tied up here.

853
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,600
Okay.

854
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,200
What's he do for a living?

855
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,040
He used to be in shipping.

856
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,480
Is he good for you?

857
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,160
Are you happy?

858
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,680
You know me. I try too hard.

859
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:13,200

860
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,880
Here you go.

861
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,040
Sleep well.

862
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,400
Good night.

863
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,080
I'll sleep on the floor.

864
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,520
This was when?
1 1 :45 a.m.

865
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:40,080
Which is definitely within
the driving range of Paris.

866
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,960
The call came from a rest stop.

867
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,240
Yeah. What's this yellow pin?

868
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,080
She spent two months there in 1997.

869
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,200
Closest town is Riom.

870
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,360
We took her family's phone records
and collated the international calls.

871
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,200
They were in Paris at 2.:00 a.m.

872
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:59,120
They can't fly. The train's too dangerous.

873
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,840
He knows better than to go anywhere
we might track him.

874
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,800
So this is our best guess.

875
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,400

876
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,720
-What are you doing?
-The kids. I was worried. I couldn't sleep.

877
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,720
You'll wake them up. We got to go.

878
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,880
I don't want to know who I am anymore.

879
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:11,120
I don't care. I don't want to know.

880
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:16,920
Come on. We'll talk about--
I want to forget everything.

881
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,480
It's okay.

882
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,720
I don't care who I am
or what I did.

883
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,280
It's okay.

884
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,720
We have this money.

885
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,400
We can hide.

886
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:32,560
Can we do that?
Is there any chance you can do that?

887
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,360
I don't know.

888
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,120
Come on.

889
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,320
890
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,040
Here, boy! Here, boy!

891
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:01,640
'Morning.

892
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,960
Christ. You were up early.

893
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,160
Bless you for making coffee.

894
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,120
One night. You weren't kidding.

895
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,680
For a change.

896
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,000
He's not there either.

897
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,560
And you looked by the car?
He's not anywhere.

898
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,160
All right, let me get dressed.

899
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,680
Who?
Bloody dog's gone missing.

900
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,320
Does that happen a lot?

901
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,800
What? That mutt?
Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.

902
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,640
It's always something, right?

903
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,600
Get in the basement.

904
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,760
What?

905
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,240
-Get everyone in the basement.
-What are you talking about?

906
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:48,080
You're in danger. Your family's in danger.
I don't have time to explain.

907
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:50,000
Wait a minute. What--
Eamon.

908
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,440
You should go.

909
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,000
What have you done?
It's not her. It's me.

910
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:57,400
You need to get out of sight
and in the basement as quick as you can.

911
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:58,960
Daddy.

912
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,320
I'm sorry.

913
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,640
Let's go.

914
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,120

915
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,520
The phone is dead.
Yeah.

916
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,160
Jason, who's out there? Who is it?

917
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,560

918
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,360
What are you doing?

919
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,320
Oh, no.

920
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:57,200
We should never have come here.
I.... These children....

921
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,800
That's not gonna happen.

922
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,280

923
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,080
924
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,960

925
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:29,520

926
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,480

927
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,320
Where is it? Where's the weapon?

928
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:29,800
Who else is out here?
Who else? How many you got with you?

929
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,440
I'm not gonna ask you again.

930
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,160
I work alone. Like you.

931
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,320
We always work alone.

932
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,160
What do you mean?
Who are you? Rome?

933
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,480
Paris?

934
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,200
Treadstone, both of us.

935
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,920
Treadstone?
Which one?

936
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,520
Paris. I live in Paris.

937
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,240
You get the headaches?

938
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,000
Yeah.

939
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,040
I get such bad headaches.

940
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,720
You know at night
when you're driving a car?

941
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,360
Maybe it's the headlights.

942
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:01,120
What is Treadstone?

943
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,240
Treadstone said pills.

944
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,800
They said go to Paris.

945
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,160
Is Treadstone in Paris?

946
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,560
Look at this.

947
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,720
Look at what they make you give.

948
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,360
All right, all right.

949
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,160
All right, Claudia,
get in the front and put your belt on.

950
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,360
All right, we're gonna put you in the back.

951
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,480
All right, get in the front, Claudia.

952
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,560
I'm not waiting, Marie.

953
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,600
-One minute, Eamon.
-I'm not waiting!

954
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,200
Please!

955
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:03,360
Take it.

956
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,760
I took out $30,000.
The rest is yours.

957
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,600
That's it?
That's all I got.

958
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,880
No, that's not what I meant.

959
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:17,280
This is not gonna stop, Marie.
You got to get out now. Away from me.

960
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,080
You got to get out.
You got to start running.

961
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,280
You get low, you stay low.

962
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,960
No more friends. Nothing familiar.

963
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:30,960
There's enough in there for you
to make a life. Any life.

964
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:32,520
I'm out of here, Marie!

965
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,600
Hey!

966
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,360
Get in the car. You got to go.

967
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,560
What are you gonna do?

968
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,520
I'll end it.

969
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,520
Go ahead.

970
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,240
Please.

971
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:54,640

972
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,040
Code in, please.

973
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,160
Code in.

974
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,480
Code in.

975
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,000
Who is this?

976
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,240
Who the hell are you?

977
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,480
The man you sent is dead.

978
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,800
So whoever this is, you better start talking.

979
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,600
Hello, Jason.

980
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,840
So, what are we into now?

981
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:51,360
It only goes two ways. Either you come in
and let us make this right...

982
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,360
...or we'll keep going until we're satisfied.

983
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,160
You mean until you kill me.

984
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:59,520
I can't fix this
if I don't know what the problem is.

985
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:02,160
Tell me what we're into,
and I'll do the best I can.

986
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:12,480
Why don't you talk to Marie, Jason?

987
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:17,880
Let's ask Marie what she wants.
I don't think she gives a shit.

988
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,440
She's dead.

989
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,400
I'm sorry to hear that.
How did that happen?

990
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,400
She was slowing me down.

991
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:36,160
All we've been doing right from--
Enough.

992
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:37,200
Enough.

993
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,720
5:30 p.m. Paris.

994
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,560
Today. Pont Neuf.

995
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:45,200
Come alone,
you walk to the middle of that bridge.

996
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,120
You take off your jacket. Face east.

997
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,160
I'll redial this number.
Wait!

998
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:52,240

999
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:57,880

1000
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,280
First flight out. Tell Nicky I'll call
from the car. Tell her to find Picot. Go.

1001
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,280
So....

1002
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,360
What are we gonna do?

1003
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,760
I told you I'd clean this up.
That's what I'm doing.

1004
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,440
Can you really bring him in?

1005
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,120
I think we're past that, don't you?

1006
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,320
Do you have a better idea?

1007
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,960
You've given me nothing
but a trail of collateral damage...

1008
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:23,320
...from Zurich to Paris.
I couldn't do much worse.

1009
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,160
Why don't you go upstairs
and book a conference room?

1010
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,480
Maybe you can talk him to death.

1011
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,440

1012
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,840

1013
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,240
The bus, the tour bus, second level.

1014
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,640
Negative on the target.

1015
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,080
Position one?
Negative.

1016
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,320
Position two?
Negative.

1017
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,680

1018
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:12,160
Position three, motorcycle.

1019
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:14,480
Negative.

1020
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:15,600
Negative.

1021
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,880

1022
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,920
Jason?

1023
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:43,760
I toId you to come aIone.
I guess that was too compIicated.

1024
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,600
So try this: I'm gone.

1025
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:50,600
Fuck.

1026
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:53,360

1027
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,120
Get Nicky on the phone.

1028
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,120

1029
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,120
Yeah?

1030
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,680
How long to wipe down the room
and move it?

1031
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,640
Get rid of everything?
Yeah.

1032
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,960
Two to three hours.
All right, get started.

1033
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,000
Listen, no breaks.

1034
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,880
Two men outside, one in the lobby.
And keep your eyes open.

1035
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,400
Keep the truck?
Keep the truck.

1036
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:41,720
I'm gonna cIose this unit down.
We'll move the gear in the truck.

1037
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,920
They were covering Spain, MaIta, Morocco.

1038
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,480
Yes, all IocaI poIice radio traffic.

1039
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:06,960
No, for northern Europe
we need an authorized directive. Yeah.

1040
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:11,200
Okay, they're on it. We'll have
a sateIIite downIoad in 30 minutes.

1041
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,760

1042
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,960

1043
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:04,520

1044
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:19,560
Where's your field box?

1045
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:27,040
-Where's your field box?
-It's right there.

1046
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,520
The whoIe system's gone haywire.

1047
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,480
That's this window right here.

1048
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,680
Dining room window?

1049
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:37,600
I don't get it.

1050
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,640
Dead. The phones are dead.

1051
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:44,840
It's Bourne, isn't it?

1052
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,160
Just quiet.

1053
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,400
You move, you die.

1054
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:35,960
Bourne.

1055
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,560
Gun down.

1056
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,320
In there.

1057
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:47,720
Okay, so what do you want--

1058
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,160
Treadstone.

1059
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:52,120
You better take a look around.
There's not much Ieft.

1060
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,560
-Are you Treadstone?
-Am I Treadstone? Me?

1061
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:56,600
What the hell are you taIking about?

1062
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:58,080
He's lost it.

1063
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:02,320
You better start fiIIing in the bIanks here!
'Cause I thought we were on the same side.

1064
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:03,600
Whose side is that?

1065
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:07,400
You don't know what you're doing, do you?
You don't have a goddamn cIue!

1066
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:09,120
Who am I?

1067
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:11,080
You're U.S. government property!

1068
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:14,240
You're a maIfunctioning $30 miIIion weapon!

1069
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,440
You're a totaI goddamn catastrophe!

1070
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:19,440
And, by God, if it kiIIs me,
you'll teII me how this happened.

1071
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,400
-Why are you trying to kill me?
-What happened in MarseiIIes?

1072
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,680
You sent me to kill Wombosi.

1073
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:28,240
KiII Wombosi?
Yeah, we can do that any time we want.

1074
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,600
I can send Nicky to do that,
for Christ's sake.

1075
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:33,520
Mr. Wombosi was supposed to be dead
three weeks ago.

1076
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:37,120
He was supposed to have died in a way
that the only possibIe expIanation was...

1077
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,440
...that he'd been murdered
by a member of his own entourage.

1078
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,240
I don't send you to kill.

1079
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:43,920
I send you to be invisibIe.

1080
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,160
I send you because you don't exist.

1081
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:48,400
I want to know what happened in Marseilles.

1082
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,160
I don't remember what happened
in MarseiIIes.

1083
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:53,960
BuIIshit! This is unacceptabIe, soIdier.

1084
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,640
You hear me? You faiIed!

1085
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:57,120
-UnacceptabIe?
-You faiIed!

1086
01:38:57,240 --> 01:39:00,760
-You faiIed and you're gonna teII me why!
-I can't teII you! I don't remember!

1087
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,920
You brought Kane to Iife.
You put together a meeting with Wombosi.

1088
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,520
You found the security company.
You broke iInto the office!

1089
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:10,400
For Christ's sake, you picked the yacht
as the goddamn strike point!

1090
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,080
You picked the boat.

1091
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:22,000
You picked the day. You tracked the crew.

1092
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:23,520
The food, the fuel!

1093
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:26,240
You told us where. You told us when.

1094
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:29,240
You hid out on that boat five days.

1095
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,880
You were in, Jason. You were in!

1096
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:33,400
It was over!

1097I
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:36,960

1098
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,760

1099
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:22,840

1100
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,000

1101
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,280
No, you do remember.

1102
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:37,480
Don't you?

1103
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:45,400
I don't want to do this anymore.

1104
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:49,040
I don't think that's a decision you can make.

1105
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,440
Jason Bourne is dead. Do you hear me?

1106
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:58,320
He drowned two weeks ago.

1107
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,680
You're gonna go teII them Bourne is dead.
Understand?

1108
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:02,680
Where are you gonna go?

1109
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:07,120
I swear, if I even feeI somebody behind me,
there is no measure to how fast...

1110
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:10,360
...and how hard I will bring this fight
to your doorstep.

1111
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,440
I'm on my own side now.

1112
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:51,000

1113I
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,560

1114
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:07,520
1115
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,360
It's done.

1116
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:41,560
Shut it down.

1117
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:59,240

1118
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:21,040
The Treadstone project
has already been terminated.

1119
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:24,160
It was designed primarily
as a sort of advanced game program.

1120
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:26,840
We'd hoped it might build
into a good training platform.

1121
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:30,360
But quite honestly,
for a strictly theoretical exercise...

1122
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:32,680
...the cost-benefit ratio was just too high.

1123
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:34,760
It's all but decommissioned at this point.

1124
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:36,360
All right, what's next?
I
1125
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:38,680
Okay, this is...

1126
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:41,400
...Blackbriar.

1127
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:44,560
Blackbriar is a joint DOD
communications program...

1128
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:48,560
...that we really feel has good traction to it.
It's got legs. It'll run and run.

1129
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:52,640
It combines elements of proactive
and reactive fields of security....

1130
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:36,000
This your store?

1131
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,160
Yeah.

1132
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:42,520
It's nice. It's a IittIe hard to find, but....

1133
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:48,560
Think I couId rent a scooter?

1134
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:53,960
You have ID?

1135
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:56,640
Not really.
