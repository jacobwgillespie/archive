16
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,480
What are you doing to me?

19
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,400
Where am I?

28
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,840
Oh, shoot.

37
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,720
Oh, lie down.

59
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,840
No, it's not coming back!
That's the point!

60
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,680
I'm down here looking through this,
all this stuff!

314
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,640
Now, who is that?

370
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,640
I don't recognize any of this.

373
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,960
Oh, the money. Right.

458
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,920
Oh, my!

467
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,800
How did you get my.... My!

503
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,000
 I told you to stay in the car.

598
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,720
You need to bring me back
that kid's head...

722
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,000
Get out of here.

754
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,080
What are you doing?

785
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,400
What is the French word for ''stakeout''?

833
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:40,560
That's Eamon. I'll talk to him.
We're leaving.

835
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,720
It's me, Marie. Wow...

851
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,720
Mommy is away for two days.

892
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,960
You were up early.

976
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,240
Who are you?

987
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:17,880
Let's ask Marie what she wants.
I don't think she cares at all.

1061
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:56,600
What are you talking about?

1065
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:07,400
You don't know what you're doing, do you?
You don't have a clue!

1069
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,440
You're a total catastrophe!

1070
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:19,440
And, if it kills me,
you'll tell me how this happened.

1074
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,600
I can send Nicky to do that!

1089
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:10,400
You picked the yacht
as the  strike point!
